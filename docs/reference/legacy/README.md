# Legacy Reference Documentation

This folder contains **archived reference materials** that are no longer current but preserved for historical context. These documents may reflect old project naming, superseded architecture, or historical decision-making.

## Contents

- **neo-darwin-manifesto-updates.md** — Archived project rename notes
  - Historical record of "Neo-Darwin" → "Amalgam" transition
  - Useful for cross-referencing old documentation
  - See `RENAME-TRACKING.md` in parent folder for cleaner rename history

## When to Use This Folder

- **Searching for old project naming** → Find references before the "Amalgam" rename
- **Understanding project evolution** → See how the project thinking changed
- **Cross-referencing old conversations** → Links to historical context
