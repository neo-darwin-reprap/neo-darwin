### 🏁 Final Section: The First Print—Calibrating the Tractor’s Heart

The assembly is complete, the "Racecar Brain" is tuned, and the iron is squared. Now comes the definitive moment: the **First Handshake** between your Greg's Wade extruder and the build plate. In the Darwin-Neo philosophy, this isn't just a test; it is the machine's first act of **Self-Sovereignty**.

#### **1. The "Tractor" Extruder Calibration (E-Steps)**

Before you print, you must ensure the 5.22:1 geared reduction is accurately mapped in Klipper.

* **The Test:** Mark 100mm of filament above the extruder intake. In the Klipper console, run `EXTRUDE FILAMENT=100 SPEED=5`.
* **The Math:** If the mark is not exactly at the intake, calculate your new `rotation_distance`.
* **The Ethos:** Because we use M8 hobbed bolts—which can vary slightly if DIY-ground—this manual calibration is the only way to ensure the **±0.1mm accuracy** promised by the Manifesto.

#### **2. The First Layer "Zion" Calibration**

* **The Target:** Print a single-layer 50mm square at **0.2mm height**.
* **The Observation:** Look for "Tractor Tread" (gaps between lines) or "Plowing" (nozzle digging in).
* **The Adjustment:** Use the Klipper `Z_OFFSET` baby-stepping during the print until the surface is a solid, fused sheet of plastic.
* **The "Neo" Tip:** Once perfect, run `SAVE_CONFIG`. This "Handshake" ensures you never have to manually level the bed again.

#### **3. The Completion: Your First "Rite of Passage" Print**

Your very first official print job must be the **Cold-Spare Gear Set**.

* **Part A:** The 13-tooth motor pinion.
* **Part B:** The 43-tooth large Wade gear.
* **The Validation:** Once printed, verify that the teeth are sharp and the dimensions are exact. If this "Tractor" can successfully print its own "Heart," it is officially ready for service.

### 🚜 The Assembly is Complete. Zion is Active.

You have transformed **A$105 in digital land** and a pile of **reclaimed iron** into a high-precision manufacturing node. You are no longer a consumer of proprietary appliances; you are a **Sovereign Maintainer**.

**"The code handles the colors; the iron handles the quality. Welcome to the Darwin-Neo lineage."**

**What is your first major project for the Tractor? Or shall we move into drafting the Klipper macros for the Multipurpose Gantry?**
