Choosing between the **E3D V6** and a higher-volume option like the **Volcano** (or a **CHT nozzle** upgrade) is a classic "Tractor" optimization. You aren't limiting yourself by choosing the V6; rather, you are selecting the most compatible baseline in history.

### 1. The "V3" vs "V6" Clarification

The **E3D V6** (released in 2014) is the industry standard you are likely looking for. The "V3" is a very early, obsolete version; in the world of 2026 scavenger builds, "V6" is the "battle-tested" legendary unit that fits the Darwin-Neo ethos perfectly.

### 2. Does High Torque Require High Volume?

Not necessarily, but they are great partners.

* **The "Tractor" Synergy:** High-torque extruders (like your Greg's Wade) are excellent at pushing filament, but if the hotend can't melt it fast enough, you'll get "back-pressure".
* **Detailed Prints:** High-volume hotends do **not** inherently ruin detail. Detail is primarily a function of **nozzle size** and **layer height**. You can run a 0.4mm nozzle on a high-flow hotend and get beautiful, intricate results.
* **The Benefit:** A high-volume hotend simply allows you to maintain consistent quality at the higher end of your 70–120mm/s speed range without the extruder "clicking" from resistance.

### 3. "Battle-Tested" High-Volume Options (Budget Friendly)

If you want to optimize 20 years of tech without blowing the $300 AUD budget, here are the two strongest paths:

#### **Option A: The CHT Nozzle Upgrade (The "Cheap" 2026 Trick)**

Instead of buying a new hotend, just put a **CHT (Core Heating Technology) Clone Nozzle** into your V6.

* **How it works:** It has a "three-way" internal splitter that melts the filament from the inside out.
* **The Result:** It can nearly **double the flow rate** of a standard V6 (moving from ~12mm³/s to ~20+mm³/s) for about **$5–$10 AUD**.
* **Ethos Fit:** It’s a "software-style" hardware upgrade—intelligence inside the nozzle rather than a bulky new heater block.

#### **Option B: The E3D Volcano (The "Heavy Duty" Choice)**

This is a longer heater block that gives the filament more time to melt.

* **Pros:** Absolute "Tractor" reliability for large parts and thick layers. It is extremely difficult to jam.
* **Cons:** It is physically longer, so you lose about 10–20mm of Z-height. It can also be more prone to "oozing" because of the larger mass of molten plastic.
* **Cost:** High-quality clones (TriangleLab/Mellow) are roughly **$15–$25 AUD**.

### 🚀 The "Neo" Verdict

For the **Darwin-Neo**, the most optimized path is a **High-Quality V6 Clone** paired with a **CHT Clone Nozzle**.

* It keeps the toolhead **compact and light**.
* It provides enough flow to handle the 5.22:1 torque of the Wade at 120mm/s.
* It maintains the ability to do **ultra-fine detail** (with 0.4mm or 0.2mm nozzles) for your multi-color "finished product" factory.
