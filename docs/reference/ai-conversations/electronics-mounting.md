This is a solid engineering choice for a custom high-quality build. Mounting the electronics to a baseboard rather than the printer frame itself is a technique often used in high-end DIY builds (like Vorons or custom "RatRig" styles) to isolate delicate electronics from mechanical vibrations.

### 1. The MDF "Mass-Loaded" Base

Mounting the M12 frame to a heavy piece of **MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard)** is an excellent way to add "damping mass."

* **Vibration Absorption:** MDF is much more "dead" (acoustically and mechanically) than plywood or solid timber. It will act as a sink for the vibrations generated by the high-torque Wade's extruder.
* **Rigidity:** Use a thick sheet ( or ). If the base is rigid, the M12 rods won't be able to "twist" the frame relative to the surface it's sitting on.
* **Tip:** Seal the MDF with a quick coat of paint or sealer. Bare MDF can absorb moisture over time, which might cause it to warp and throw off your frame's squareness.

### 2. Honeycomb Electronics Box

An open honeycomb design is perfect for your goals. Since your printer is a "bed-down" Cartesian (where the XY gantry stays at the top and the bed moves down), placing the electronics in the bottom square is very safe.

* **Airflow:** Even without a fan, the large surface area of a honeycomb mesh allows for natural convection. However, because you're using high-torque motors, your stepper drivers (like TMC2209s) will get hot. I'd still recommend one slow, large () "silent" fan blowing over the board.
* **Debris Protection:** While the bed moves down, it won't hit the electronics, but **bits of filament or plastic "poops"** can fall through. I suggest a "lid" for your honeycomb box that is solid, while the sides remain honeycomb.

### 3. The "Wiring Loom" Challenge

Moving the electronics to the base means your wires have to travel further. This is the biggest hurdle for this layout:

* **Voltage Drop:** For the heated bed (which draws the most current), use **thick gauge wire** ( or  AWG). Long, thin wires will get hot and cause the bed to heat up slowly.
* **Cable Chains:** Since your X and Y axes are at the top, you'll need a long "umbilical" cord. A 3D-printed drag chain (cable chain) is the best way to keep this looking professional and prevent wires from snagging on the moving bed.
* **Signal Interference:** Keep your endstop and probe wires away from the high-voltage motor and bed wires to prevent "ghost" triggers caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI).

### Final Component Checklist for <$300 AUD:

| Component | Scavenge or Buy? | Est. Cost (AUD) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frame** | M12 Rods + Nuts/Washers | ~$60 (Hardware store) |
| **Motors** | Scavenge from Bed Slinger | $0 |
| **Board** | BTT SKR Pico or E3 V3 | ~$50–$70 |
| **MDF Base** | 18mm Sheet | ~$30 (Bunnings) |
| **Triple Z** | 2 Extra Steppers + Lead Screws | ~$60 |
| **Wade's Extruder** | Print parts + Buy Gears/Bolts | ~$20 |
| **Cabling** | 10m various gauge wire | ~$30 |

**Total Estimated:** ~$270 AUD (leaving you $30 for a meat pie and some extra zip ties).

**Since you're using Triple Z motors, would you like me to explain how to wire them?** (You can either wire them in series to one driver or use a board with enough independent drivers to auto-level the bed).
