Including links to other projects is an excellent way to acknowledge the "shoulders of giants" upon which the Darwin-Neo stands. It frames your build not as a isolated experiment, but as a deliberate choice within a broader ecosystem of engineering philosophies.

The **Bear Upgrade** and **The 100** are perfect thematic bookends for your project, representing the two extremes—Rigidity and Speed—that the Darwin-Neo harmonizes.

### 🔗 Recommended Project Links

You can add a section titled **"The Darwin-Neo Lineage & Inspiration"** to your manifesto:

#### **1. The Prusa Bear Upgrade (The Rigidity Benchmark)**

* **The Connection:** Like the Bear, the Darwin-Neo focuses on **frame stiffness** as the key to quality.
* **The Difference:** While the Bear uses expensive V-Slot aluminum extrusions, we use the "Scavenger's Iron" (M12 threaded rods) to achieve similar resonance damping at a fraction of the cost.
* **Link:** [Prusa Bear Upgrade GitHub](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade)

#### **2. The 100 (The Speed Benchmark)**

* **The Connection:** "The 100" proved that you can achieve world-class speed on a **printed frame** using Klipper.
* **The Difference:** "The 100" is a specialized racecar for "Speedboats". The Darwin-Neo takes those software lessons (Klipper, Input Shaping) and applies them to a high-mass "Tractor" frame built for 24/7 reliability rather than drag racing.
* **Link:** [The 100 on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/572689-the-100-v11-the-fastest-3d-printer-based-on-a-prin)

#### **3. The RepRap Wiki (The Ancestral Archive)**

* **The Connection:** This is the library of our "Founding Fathers." Linking here reminds builders that they are part of a 20-year history of **Self-Replicating Machines**.
* **The Invitation:** Use this for inspiration to see how the "Darwin" evolved into the "Mendel," the "Prusa," and finally the "Neo".
* **Link:** [RepRap Machine Family Tree](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Machines)

### 💡 Why these links work for your "Seed"

* **The Bear** validates your focus on **structural authority**.
* **The 100** validates your focus on **software intelligence**.
* **The RepRap Wiki** validates your focus on **sovereignty and salvage**.

### Final Suggestion for the "Opinion" Seed

You might add this concluding note:

> *"The Darwin-Neo is my opinion on what a 2026 printer should be: a machine that values iron over plastic and code over cloud. These links are the seeds that grew this project; use them to grow your own."*

This turns your project into a **"Reference Design"** rather than just a set of instructions, encouraging others to fork it and adapt it to their own scavenger finds.





That M12 build you found, the **"RepRap Mendel Revisited,"** is a beautiful example of the "nostalgia-plus-performance" trend in the maker community. It confirms exactly what the **Darwin-Neo** manifesto argues: that the iconic threaded-rod shapes of early RepRaps are mechanically sound foundations that just needed modern "Racecar Brains" to shine.

There is a vibrant community of makers still doing custom builds that align with your **"Tractor with a Racecar Brain"** ethos.

### 1. The "Heritage" Builds: Modernizing the Iron

The project you found (Thingiverse 6783269) was actually released to celebrate the **RepRap Mendel's anniversary**. Like your project, it uses **M12 threaded rods** for a sturdier frame and integrates an **E3D V6** and **Bondtech-style geared extrusion** to fix the original Mendel's weaknesses.

Other similar "Heritage" efforts include:

* **Voron Legacy:** A "nostalgic" project from the high-end Voron team designed to recreate the spirit of early DIY printers using modern toolheads and Klipper firmware.
* **RepRap Micron:** Introduced in 2025 by RepRap pioneer Vik Olliver, this project returns to a largely 3D-printed frame and threaded-rod drives to achieve micro-level precision for just a few hundred dollars.

### 2. The "Performance Scavengers": High Intelligence on a Budget

If the Darwin-Neo is the "Tractor," these projects are its "Rally Car" cousins. They prove that you can take cheap parts and achieve world-class results through software:

* **The 100:** Currently one of the most popular DIY builds, it uses a 100% printed frame to reach extreme speeds (Speedboats in under 6 minutes). It follows your logic that **Klipper software** is the secret sauce that makes inexpensive hardware perform.
* **The Rook:** Often recommended as a "better understanding of its limits" compared to the high-speed racecars, the Rook focuses on being a reliable, easy-to-service 3D-printed machine for the community.

### 3. High-End Open Ecosystems

While these are more expensive, they are the "North Star" for what your modular puck and gantry can eventually achieve:

* **Voron Trident:** Known for the same **3-point kinematic leveling** you've included in the Darwin-Neo, the Trident is the gold standard for a rigid, "set-and-forget" DIY machine.
* **Rat Rig V-Core 4:** Recently updated in 2024/2025, it uses a "Hybrid" motion system to push large-scale printing to its limits while remaining 100% open-source.

### 💡 Why Your Project is a "Seed"

The fact that you found an M12 Mendel revisit proves there is a **hunger for "Heavy Iron" builds**. Most modern DIY printers have moved to aluminum extrusions, which are expensive and harder to scavenge than threaded rods.

By linking to the **[RepRap Machines Family Tree](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Machines)** and these modern builds, you are positioning the **Darwin-Neo** as the missing link: a machine that has the **low-cost salvageability** of a 2007 Mendel but the **automated precision** of a 2026 Voron.

**"You aren't just building a printer; you're joining a 20-year conversation about sovereignty."**


Linking to the **Prusa i3 Rework** is a fantastic idea. It serves as the critical historical link between the "archaeological" RepRaps and the modern machines we see today.

While the original 2007 Darwin was the pioneer, the **i3 Rework (circa 2014)** was arguably the first "Tractor" to become a global standard. It’s where many of your core components—like the **Greg's Wade extruder** and the **M10/M12 threaded rod Y-axis**—were refined into the versions we scavenge today.

### Why the i3 Rework belongs in your Lineage:

* **The M10/M12 Pivot:** The i3 Rework was one of the first major variants to push for 10mm threaded rods over the original 8mm spec, specifically to solve the "wobble" that plagued early RepRaps. This directly validates your **Darwin-Neo M12 skeleton**.
* **The Extruder Standard:** The Rework version of the Greg's Wade (specifically the "Bob's Your Uncle" or "Compact" remixes) is the most compatible and widely documented version for the E3D V6.
* **The Scavenger's Goldmine:** Most "generic" Prusa clones from the 2015–2018 era (Anet A8, RepRapGuru) are actually based on the i3 Rework files.

### Suggested Addition to the "Lineage" Section:

> #### **4. The Prusa i3 Rework (The 2014 Workhorse)**
> 
> 
> * **The Connection:** The Rework was the first project to "standardize" the scavenger build. It proved that a mixture of threaded rods and a single laser-cut frame could create a high-quality production machine.
> * **The Legacy:** If the Darwin was the prototype, the Rework was the "Tractor" that actually built the community. It’s the source of the high-torque **Greg's Wade** heritage we use today.

### 💡 The "Darwin-Neo" Positioning

Adding the i3 Rework helps you explain the "Neo" part of the name:

1. **Darwin (2007):** The original boxy iron logic.
2. **i3 Rework (2014):** The refinement of geared torque and heavy rods.
3. **Darwin-Neo (2026):** The fusion of that heavy iron with the **Racecar Brain** (Klipper).

This makes your "opinionated" build feel like the natural next step in a 20-year evolution. You aren't just building a printer; you are providing the **2026 Update** to a lineage that has been working for two decades.


This reads excellently. It successfully bridges the gap between the "high-tech" future of 3D printing and the "scavenger" roots of the movement. By framing these other projects as a "Lineage," you make the **Darwin-Neo** feel like an inevitable evolution rather than a random DIY project.

Here are a few small refinements to polish the text (fixing a few typos and smoothing the transition between your personal notes and the reworded section):

### 🛠️ Suggested Tiny Tweaks:

1. **Typo in Header:** Change `## Comunity Support` to `## Community Support`.
2. **Macro phrasing:** In the first paragraph, change `appreciate a pull-request it back` to `please submit a pull-request to fold it back`.
3. **Spelling in Point 4:** Change `remoinds` to `reminds`.
4. **Consolidation:** Since you have two "intro" sections for the links, I would merge them to avoid repetition.

### Revised Community Section (Final Polish):

---

## 🌐 Community Support & The Zion Codebase

The Darwin-Neo is a community effort. If you find a better way to scavenge a part or write a more efficient macro, please submit a pull-request to fold it back into the "Zion" codebase for everyone.

### 📜 The Zion Rite of Passage

Historically, a RepRap builder's "Rite of Passage" was to use their first machine to print parts for **two more machines** for others *at cost*. In a world of proprietary "Cloud" appliances, we choose the Red Pill. We choose the code, the torque, and the iron.

## 🏛️ Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

The Darwin-Neo is not an island; it is a 2026 entry into a long-running conversation about mechanical sovereignty. These projects are our ancestors, cousins, and North Stars.

### 1. Heritage Builds: Modernizing the Iron

* **Prusa i3 Rework (2014):** The historical workhorse that standardized the high-torque **Greg's Wade** extruder and 10mm rod foundations we scavenge today. [Wiki Link]
* **RepRap Mendel Revisited (M12):** A project that validates our skeleton choice. It uses **M12 threaded rods** to fix the "wobble" of early designs, proving threaded-rod frames remain a premier engineering choice for rigidity. [Link]
* **Voron Legacy:** A "nostalgic" project from the Voron team that celebrates old-school aesthetics while utilizing modern Klipper firmware.
* **RepRap Micron:** A return to the roots by pioneer Vik Olliver, using threaded-rod drives to achieve micro-level precision.

### 2. Performance Scavengers: High Intelligence on a Budget

If Darwin-Neo is the Tractor, these are its "Rally Car" cousins—proving that software intelligence can make inexpensive parts perform like elite hardware.

* **The 100:** A printed-frame speed machine that uses Klipper as the "secret sauce" to reach world-class velocities. High-performance printing is a software math problem, not a spending problem. [Link]
* **The Rook:** A community favorite that prioritizes ease of service. It represents the same "User-as-Maintainer" philosophy that drives the Darwin-Neo.

### 3. High-End Open Ecosystems: Our "North Stars"

These builds provide the technical blueprints for the Darwin-Neo’s advanced features.

* **Voron Trident:** The gold standard for rigid, "set-and-forget" DIY machines. The Darwin-Neo’s **3-point kinematic leveling** is a direct nod to the Trident’s approach to bed stability.
* **Prusa Bear Upgrade:** Like the Bear, the Darwin-Neo focuses on **frame stiffness**. While the Bear uses aluminum, we use "Scavenger's Iron" to achieve similar damping at a fraction of the cost. [Link]
* **Rat Rig V-Core 4:** A pinnacle of open-source engineering that serves as an inspiration for what our **Modular Puck** system can achieve.

> *"The Darwin-Neo is my opinion on what a 2026 printer should be: a machine that values iron over plastic and code over cloud. These links are the seeds that grew this project; use them to grow your own. You aren't just building a printer; you're joining a 20-year conversation about sovereignty."*

### Why this is the "Final Boss" of Community Sections:

* **The "Rite of Passage"** bit adds serious "Old School Cool" factor. It challenges the builder to be part of something bigger.
* **The "Zion" branding** ties back into the Red Pill/Neo theme without being "too cute," as it’s now explicitly linked to the codebase.
* **Categorization:** By splitting them into "Heritage," "Scavengers," and "North Stars," you explain *why* each link is relevant to the Darwin-Neo specifically.

**How does this flow feel to you? Ready to commit to the README?**


The **Prusa i3 Rework** (circa 2014) was indeed the definitive era for the **Greg's Wade's Geared Extruder**. It solidified the Wade as the "Tractor" of the industry before the community shifted toward smaller, direct-drive units.

By linking these specific projects, you are showing that the **Darwin-Neo** isn't just a collection of random parts, but a curated "Best Of" 20 years of RepRap history.

### 🚜 Validating the Lineage

* **The i3 Rework Connection:** You are correct; the Rework standardized the high-torque Wade setup you've chosen. It proved that a **geared mechanical advantage** was the most reliable way to handle the "unpredictable" filaments often used by early makers.
* **The Mendel Revisited Connection:** This project is your modern "M12 Ally". It proves that the "old" threaded-rod shape—when upgraded with a **V6 hotend**—still provides a level of structural authority that modern thin-walled extrusions struggle to match.
* **The "Box-Frame" Cousins (The 100 & The Rook):** These projects validate your move away from the "bed-slinger" design. They prove that keeping the motion system contained within a **rigid cube** is the only way to achieve modern quality at higher speeds.

### 🛠️ Final Polish for the "Community" Section

Based on your input, here is how you can finalize that specific part of the manifesto to ensure the "Rework" and "Mendel" connections are clear:

> #### **The Lineage of the Tractor**
> 
> 
> * **Prusa i3 Rework:** The source of our **Geared Extruder** heritage. It proved that "Tractor" torque is the best defense against extrusion inconsistency.
> * **Mendel Revisited:** A modern nod to the **M12 skeleton**. It shares our philosophy that high-mass iron is a feature, not a bug.
> * **The 100 / The Rook:** Our box-frame cousins who proved that **Klipper software** is the "Racecar Brain" required to make DIY frames truly fast and accurate.
> 
> 

**This feels like a complete and powerful manifesto.** You have successfully taken a complex engineering project and given it a soul, a nickname ("The Tractor"), and a clear historical context.

**Are you ready to finalize this version of the README, or is there one last "Tractor" tweak we should make?**
